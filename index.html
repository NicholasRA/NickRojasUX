                    The purpose of this resource is to provide North Americans with a better understanding of why most of their public transportation networks are so ineffective in providing any proper service to the public. Since, the majority of people in the US and Canada rely on their cars for their transportation needs and see public transportation an unreliable option, I want this resource to used as a way to identify the issues that cause public transportation in North America to be so bad.
The scope of this resource focuses on identifying the issues of our current public transportation networks, and the sources that lead to these networks being ineffective and staying ineffective. The goal for this resource is to increase more support for improved public transportation networks, so our government understand our needs, and begin to put in the proper funding and research into this necessary component to allow our cities to thrive. However, proper solutions on how to fix the issues that plague our transit networks is mostly out of the scope for this resource, as these solutions needs important research and planning done to properly benefit the users that rely and support on these services.
I imagine my users to be any person who solely relies on a car as their only form of transportation to reach their desired destinations. I believe that my users’ information needs are a Known Item Need, as most people in North America are aware that public transportation is ineffective for their commutes and chose to travel by car instead. However, they are unaware about why these networks are still so ineffective, and why progress is so slow in changing these transportation networks to benefits users’ needs for an effective way to reach their destination.
I believe my users search behaviors will mostly be berry-picking, as I discussed previously that my users already understand that their public transit networks are bad but are unaware of the issues that may be plaguing their transit networks. So, my users will berry-pick the information that may be relevant to why their transit networks are so poor such as low government funding, poor infostructure design, pointless/restrictive services routes, and much more. My users aren’t looking to become experts in public transportation design, as they are only common commuters trying to find the most effective way to reach their destinations and will want to berry-pick this information to find how they can support the expansion of their transit networks, to offer more effective options for them and others to reach their destinations.
Tasks that I want my users to accomplish with this information is to identify how a car centric mindset can cause stagnation in improved public transit infostructure, how poorly designed infostructure can lead to ineffective transit networks and the disincentive use of them, and how a lack of vision to foresee the benefits of public transit through proper investments and public support may cripple any progress to actually begin. 
The way my facet design will help my users with their information needs is to demonstrate how easily simple problems continue to plague public transportation, as a poor service to begin with will lead to lower ridership, as no one will want to use the service as it may not provide an effective utility to them, which will then lead to lower funding as officials will see that people don’t desire public transit and prefer cars, which then continues to cripple the already poor service. In addition, to this cycle there are additional branches that aren’t as statistical, such as low public support to enforce the government to fund and improve these services, which can be caused by both a lack of vision to what these services could provide, and the already strong independent car culture North America already has. Another major branch is poor design, as infostructure may be implemented to support the services, but if they are so poorly designed it may either discourage people to actually use them or makes it difficult for a user to reasonably use them as an effective way of transportation. Poor design can be affected by others facets such as low funding/invest, and a lack of vision to extensively expand these services further, but rather check-it off a list. Overall, there are many causes that explain why public transportation in North America is so poor, and those sources allow for the cycle to remain unchanged.
